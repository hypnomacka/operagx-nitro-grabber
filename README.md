A simple program for getting discord nitro promotion links using opera gx api exploit

To run it just open cmd and type "java -jar nitro_grabber.jar" and it should start

If it gets rate limited even though it sends only one request per second it will wait for 5 minutes and then automatically continue

It saves all the links into a .txt file named response.txt
